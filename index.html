            <p>New York ranks among the most expensive U.S. cities to live in, and the affordable housing crisis shows no signs of letting up. An analysis of building permits data shows that new housing starts continued to contract at the start of 2025.</p>

            <p>The apartment vacancy rate in New York remains extremely low, just 1.4% at the start of the year. It hasn’t been this hard to find an apartment in the city

            <p>Analysis of 
                <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a/about_data">Department of Buildings data</a> shows that new building permits continued to fall during the first quarter of 2025.  From January 1 to March 31, only 582 new building permits were issued by the city agency. That’s down from 768 in during the first quarter of 2024 and 1,293 during the same period in 2023. The most recent peak was in 2022, when nearly 2000 new building permits were issued during the first quarter of the year.</p>

            <p>Brooklyn led the five boroughs three years in a row, with 515 new building permits issued in the first quarter of 2023, 275 in Q1 2024 and 237 in Q1 2025.</p>

        <strong>
         Market Forces Pose Risks for Developers    
        </strong>
        </p>
    </h3>


            <p>“You see almost no market rate housing getting built today,” said Mehul Patel, a veteran real estate executive and former chief of staff at Empire State Development, New York State’s economic development agency. </p>

            <p>While the demand exists, Patel said market forces, especially high interest rates for financing, make it challenging for private developers to reach their target profit margins on new construction. “ You're putting all of this money at risk to move ahead and then get the return at the end,” said Patel. ”But the return on investment is less of a guarantee at the moment. It’s a big risk.”
            </p>

            <p>That risk became evident in 2024, when the developer of Brooklyn’s tallest residential building, the Brooklyn Tower, <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/04/02/real-estate/developer-of-brooklyns-tallest-skyscraper-defaults-on-240m-loan/">defaulted on a $240 million loan.</a> When lenders finance a development project, they set a required price per square foot as part of the deal to guarantee a return on their investment. In the case of the Brooklyn Tower, prospective buyers and renters weren’t willing to pay that price. Low sales led to the default, and the <a href="https://www.6sqft.com/silverstein-take-control-over-brooklyn-tower/">lender took ownership</a> of the residential skyscraper.

        <p>
        <strong>
         Lack of New Housing Stock Compounds the Issue   
        </strong>
        </p>
    </h3>

            <p>Whether a person is looking to rent or buy an apartment in New York, the dearth of available units makes the affordable housing crisis worse. “ It’s frustrating to now truly want to buy, but not sure that we’ll be able to,” said Rosemarie Bray, who lives in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.</p>

            <p>Bray and her husband have been looking to buy an apartment for over a year. “We are public servants, a social worker and a public school teacher for 30 years. We would love to buy our home here in Brooklyn, but we waited too long to buy,” she said.</p> 

            <p>The couple lives in a rent stabilized three-bedroom apartment with their two teenage children. Bray said it’s “like golden handcuffs.” If they could find a suitable residential unit within their budget, they’d be able to leave their affordable apartment. It could then be rented to someone else with a modest income.</p> 

            <p>Because there are so few new units coming online at the moment, people like Bray stay put, and competition for the few apartments that are available increases, which then drives up the asking price.</p> 

            <p>“The most frustrating thing for us is the outrageous prices,’’ said Bray. The most they can afford to spend on housing is $5500 per month.</p>

        </p>
    </h3>

            <p>Many pieces of the puzzle need to fall in place before a developer can put shovels in the ground.  ”First of all, you need the right property… You need the right project to move forward,” said Carlo Scissura, president and CEO of the <a href= "https://buildingcongress.com/who-we-are/"> New York Building Congress</a>, a real estate development and construction trade organization. “Then, you need folks willing to take a risk and get things moving. You need banks and money and interest rates and the numbers have to pan out,” Scissura said.</p> 

            <p>New building construction permits peaked in 2022 as developers raced to start projects before a popular tax abatement law expired. The state’s 421A program deferred some costs by lowering property taxes on new projects. In exchange for the tax break, developers had to make a percentage of their new units available through the city’s <a href= "https://housingconnect.nyc.gov/PublicWeb/search-lotteries"> affordable housing lottery program</a>.</p> 

            <p>When new construction projects dwindled, lawmakers stepped in and enacted a <a href= "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/28/nyregion/421a-housing-tax-break-legislature-485x.html"> new tax abatement program called 485x</a>. The goal of the program is to reinvigorate residential construction while increasing the number of new affordable housing units. “You’re not going to really see the full impact of that for quite a while, but I think we’re in a better place,” Scissura said.</p>  

            <p>The 485x tax abatement program started taking applications toward the end of 2024. New building construction permits issued in the first quarter of 2025 do not reflect those applications. As the department of buildings releases data on building permits in the coming months, we’ll begin to see whether the new program is having its intended effect.</p>  

            <p>In the meantime, rents remain high, and the competition for affordable apartments is intense. The median rent for all apartment listings in Manhattan at the end of March was $4,750, <a href= "https://www.renthop.com/"> according to RentHop.com</a>. An average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the borough was around $6,000, while a studio listed for roughly $3500. Those prices put Manhattan out of reach for many residents of the five boroughs, where the median income for a single individual in 2023 was a little over $41,000, according to U.S. Census data.</p>  

            <p>New Yorkers spend over 54% of their income on housing costs, according to a <a href= "https://www.audacy.com/1010wins/news/local/ny-renters-spend-over-54-income-on-housing-most-in-nation"> recent report from WalletHub</a>, more than any other city in the U.S. Generally, financial advisors suggest that a household spends no more than a third of its income on housing.</p>
